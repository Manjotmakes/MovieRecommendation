The movie's introduction is a type of music video for Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" but is not the official video for the song. The film then expresses a montage of Michael's career, which leads into a parody of his Bad video titled ""Badder"", followed by sections ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"". What follows is the biggest section where Michael plays a hero with magical powers and saves three children from Mr. Big. This section is ""Smooth Criminal"" which leads into a performance of ""Come Together"".","1988-10-29","https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/3GwTPQkAcgDeAirRpEuJG8HDdRz.jpg","6.95","Fantasy, Music","False"
